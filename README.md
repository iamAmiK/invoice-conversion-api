# invoice-transformation-api

Developing an API to convert UBL JSON invoices to UBL XML invoices

Task 1: Update json to less strict schema #Done

Task 2: Add error response telling user what fields are missing but should be non-intrusive #semi-complete, logging in backend, need to report to user in output

Task 3: Make route for /Fix (adjustments for missing fields)

Later: Scope for different invoice procurements from PDF to JSON
