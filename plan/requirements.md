# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a REST API service that converts invoice data from various input formats (starting with JSON) to UBL XML format. The API will be designed with extensibility in mind to support additional input formats like PDF invoices in the future. The service will handle different JSON invoice structures and transform them into standardized UBL 2.1 XML format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating invoice systems, I want to send JSON invoice data to an API endpoint and receive UBL XML format, so that I can standardize invoice processing across different systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the conversion endpoint with valid JSON invoice data THEN the system SHALL return a valid UBL 2.1 XML invoice
2. WHEN the request includes invoice type parameter as "json" THEN the system SHALL process the JSON payload accordingly
3. WHEN the request includes output format parameter as "UBL XML" THEN the system SHALL return the converted invoice in UBL XML format
4. WHEN the conversion is successful THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 200 with the XML content
5. WHEN the input JSON is malformed THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 400 with error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to handle different JSON invoice structures, so that I can convert invoices from various source systems without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the input is UBL-specific JSON format (with _D, _A, _B namespaces) THEN the system SHALL convert it to proper UBL XML with correct namespaces
2. WHEN the input is generic JSON invoice format THEN the system SHALL map common fields to appropriate UBL XML elements
3. WHEN required UBL fields are missing from input THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults or return validation errors
4. WHEN the input contains multiple invoice lines THEN the system SHALL preserve all line items in the output XML
5. WHEN currency information is present THEN the system SHALL maintain currency codes in the converted XML

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear API documentation and error handling, so that I can easily integrate and troubleshoot the conversion service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid invoice type is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 400 with supported format list
2. WHEN an unsupported output format is requested THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 400 with available output formats
3. WHEN the service encounters internal errors THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 500 with appropriate error message
4. WHEN a request is made without required parameters THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 400 with missing parameter details
5. WHEN the API is called with GET method on the conversion endpoint THEN the system SHALL return API documentation or usage information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a future system integrator, I want the API architecture to support additional input formats, so that PDF and other invoice formats can be added later without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN it SHALL use a pluggable architecture for input format processors
2. WHEN new input formats are added THEN existing JSON conversion functionality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN the invoice type parameter specifies an unsupported format THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating available formats
4. WHEN the system processes any input format THEN it SHALL use a common internal invoice model before conversion to UBL XML
5. WHEN multiple output formats are supported in the future THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with UBL XML output

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the converted UBL XML to be valid and complete, so that downstream systems can process the invoices without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UBL XML is generated THEN it SHALL include all required UBL 2.1 elements and namespaces
2. WHEN the conversion includes party information THEN both supplier and customer party details SHALL be properly structured
3. WHEN invoice lines are converted THEN each line SHALL include required elements like ID, quantity, amount, and item details
4. WHEN monetary totals are calculated THEN they SHALL be consistent with line item amounts
5. WHEN the generated XML is validated against UBL 2.1 schema THEN it SHALL pass validation without errors
